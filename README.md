## üìöSending completed homework for feedback
Every Wednesday, in the end of the main lecture, a few take-home tasks are offered to practice the lecture material

## ü§ìHow to do it right?
You are expected to spend time reading official documentations, googling, sourcing helpful information on your own. 50% of success is in your dedication to the course material. The other 50% come from practice. This means, you should go along with course lectures and hand-in homework on-time to get a timely feedback. It is not recommended to skip parts with false hopes to learn it 'later'. You can only get the maximum if you follow the rules of our community, React-TypesScript course and from teacher's recommendations.

## üìàFAQ
+ Do I need JavaScript to learn React?
  Yes, you are expected to have a working knowledge of JS to be able to understand React concepts and not stall your learning curve.

+ How to send completed homework to get feedback?
  In order to get feedback for your completed task, push your code to a repo on your GitHub page and share the link with @Francesca in Slack.

+ Can I land a job after completing this course?
  Many factors can contribute to you landing your first or a more qualified frontend position. The matrial covered in this course can result in employent     as the skills provided here, are practical.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
